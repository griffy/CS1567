We need to have a permanent, global coordinate system so that we can say "Move to x,y" and it will never change.

When the robot first starts up, it has no way of knowing which direction it's facing with the wheel encoders. North Star will give it a "global" position. Use this initially to find where we are based on the room number and theta. 

This information needs to be saved and constantly updated so that the transformations are done correctly.
