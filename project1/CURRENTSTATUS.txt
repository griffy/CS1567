//MODIFY THIS FILE TO EXPLAIN THE STATUS OF THE PROJECT

TODO:
	

FINISHED:
	Program that measures NorthStar and Wheel Encoder data and saves to a file
	Matlab file that plots data from *.dat files
	Modify the filter on the Y axis of the NorthStar with new coefficients -- Possibly modify the X axis, but it looks decent
	Test the filter on another data point. Right now, the filter looks good in Matlab
