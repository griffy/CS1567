Coordinate transformations used to be completely erroneous. They should be fixed now. 
ROOM_2 Y value is still off, may be due to the function used to apply a variable theta transformation to ROOM_2

I couldn't get things working all too well without another hack-y correction. 
Maybe we can just address this by trusting the wheel encoders for X/Y and hoping that it evens out a bit.
I also think we could just apply a less hack-y correction by adding a term to the previous correction that is based on signal strength
	Maybe it would only be applied with signal under ~7500 (proportionally to the lack of signal strength), which corresponds to the ends of the range of room 2. 

Theta value was not properly changing on our last run as the robot spun.

Ideas for turning
	Use 20 degrees turns to close in to a large value (~50-60 degrees) and don't turn until error is this large
	Perform smaller turns at a slower pace to hone in on the right value

CHANGES THAT WE MADE
The coordinate transformations are now ~finally~ functioning. I was misusing sin() and cos() earlier in a way that was completely wrong.
We normalize the theta values when they are given to the Kalman filter to ensure that they are within the same circle (2*PI)
We are attempting to turn using the turn_20_degrees function, as we were consistently overturning previously. 
Pausing between turns seems unnecessary. Also other groups don't seem to require it.

//MODIFY THIS FILE TO EXPLAIN THE STATUS OF THE PROJECT

TODO:
	get robot moveto and turnto functions working
	change velocity function in kalman filter based on current speed/rotation
	tun PID loop

FINISHED:
	Program that measures NorthStar and Wheel Encoder data and saves to a file
	Matlab file that plots data from *.dat files
	Modify the filter on the Y axis of the NorthStar with new coefficients -- Possibly modify the X axis, but it looks decent
	Test the filter on another data point. Right now, the filter looks good in Matlab
