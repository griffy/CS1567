Improve color thresholding 
	-look at findSquares? / red-pink overlap? 

Write a new moveTo relying on Wheel Encoders for distance and NorthStar for theta values
	-moveTo next grid square, then center within that grid square, then move again
	-when nothing in front, turn clockwise in 90 degree increments until something is seen
Movement plan?: Start assuming centered in a square
		Look at markers to orient oneself in the center of the square (strafe and possibly turn)
		Once centered, move forward
		While moving forward, keep taking snapshots, correct if too much error (turn and definitely NOT strafe)
			Possibly pause and get more data a bit after turn, to avoid overcorrection
			Also inform turning based on NorthStar theta data


Filter center errors / accumulate valid slope and center error values to find meaningful errors

TODO: Tom
	Fix duplicate squares in linear regression function
		 (Make/keep track of separate list of squares after first loop through)
