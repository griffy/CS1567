Room transitions display characterstic jumps in y-values. 
	Not what was throwing off our robot at the beginning, but it can't be helping. 

TODO (for me):
	Take a closer look at NorthStar data, see if there's any possible reason that a room change (looks like any room change) would cause a very incorrect value to propagate through the filter (as it appears to be doing)
		If there is an actual 'bug' to deal with, woohoo, find it and fix it.		
	
	Measure out scaling data for NorthStar for Bender (etc...) and check room 'borders' to make transitions a bit more smooth
		If there isn't a bug above, hopefully doing this will help us.
		
	Otherwise, if room transitions are still inexplicably bad, we may want to wait and collect a few data points upon room change (it appears to fix itself, leading me to believe that its more of a bug than a legitimate deviation

Other things to be done?
	Better error parameterization of center() 
		Robot seems to get stuck often and only start moving when no squares are seen for a few frames in a row

	Addition of turning into center(), addition of camera into turnTo()?

Shoot me an email if you want any of the data I had about the room transitions.
