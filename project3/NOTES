We have to tune the precision with which the robot turns and strafes. It's too crazy right now to be useful. I think we need to look at the PID and our speed caps / number of times we send a move command.

Wheel Encoder theta lags behind NS when spinning due to the FIR filters on the WE ticks. 
	-Maybe handle the theta calculation separately and look at the raw deltas instead of the filtered values (still look at filtered values for X/Y, akin to NS)
